SELECT pgmq . drop_queue ( 'my_queue' ); drop_queue ----------------- t (1 row) Configuration \u00b6 Partitioned Queues \u00b6 You will need to install pg_partman if you want to use pgmq partitioned queues. pgmq queue tables can be created as a partitioned table by using pgmq.create_partitioned() . pg_partman handles all maintenance of queue tables. This includes creating new partitions and dropping old partitions. Partitions behavior is configured at the time queues are created, via pgmq.create_partitioned() . This function has three parameters: queue_name: text : The name of the queue. Queues are Postgres tables prepended with q_ . For example, q_my_queue . The archive is instead prefixed by a_ , for example a_my_queue . partition_interval: text - The interval at which partitions are created. This can be either any valid Postgres Duration supported by pg_partman, or an integer value. When it is a duration, queues are partitioned by the time at which messages are sent to the table ( enqueued_at ). A value of 'daily' would create a new partition each day. When it is an integer value, queues are partitioned by the msg_id . A value of '100' will create a new partition every 100 messages. The value must agree with retention_interval (time based or numeric). The default value is daily . For archive table, when interval is an integer value, then it will be partitioned by msg_id . In case of duration it will be partitioned on archived_at unlike queue table. retention_interval: text - The interval for retaining partitions. This can be either any valid Postgres Duration supported by pg_partman, or an integer value. When it is a duration, partitions containing data greater than the duration will be dropped. When it is an integer value, any messages that have a msg_id less than max(msg_id) - retention_interval will be dropped. For example, if the max msg_id is 100 and the retention_interval is 60, any partitions with msg_id values less than 40 will be dropped. The value must agree with partition_interval (time based or numeric). The default is '5 days' . Note: retention_interval does not apply to messages that have been deleted via pgmq.delete() or archived with pgmq.archive() . pgmq.delete() removes messages forever and pgmq.archive() moves messages to the corresponding archive table forever (for example, a_my_queue ). In order for automatic partition maintenance to take place, several settings must be added to the postgresql.conf file, which is typically located in the postgres DATADIR . pg_partman_bgw.interval in postgresql.conf . Below are the default configuration values set in Tembo docker images. Add the following to postgresql.conf . Note, changing shared_preload_libraries requires a restart of Postgres. pg_partman_bgw.interval sets the interval at which pg_partman conducts maintenance. This creates new partitions and dropping of partitions falling out of the retention_interval . By default, pg_partman will keep 4 partitions \"ahead\" of the currently active partition. shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_partman_bgw' # requires restart of Postgres pg_partman_bgw.interval = 60 pg_partman_bgw.role = 'postgres' pg_partman_bgw.dbname = 'postgres' Visibility Timeout (vt) \u00b6 pgmq guarantees exactly once delivery of a message within a visibility timeout. The visibility timeout is the amount of time a message is invisible to other consumers after it has been read by a consumer. If the message is NOT deleted or archived within the visibility timeout, it will become visible again and can be read by another consumer. The visibility timeout is set when a message is read from the queue, via pgmq.read() . It is recommended to set a vt value that is greater than the expected time it takes to process a message. After the application successfully processes the message, it should call pgmq.delete() to completely remove the message from the queue or pgmq.archive() to move it to the archive table for the queue. Who uses pgmq? \u00b6 As the pgmq community grows, we'd love to see who is using it. Please send a PR with your company name and @githubhandle.
